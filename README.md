# Capable-AI-desktop-assistant

Capable is a voice assistant that simplifies and consolidates any and all tasks you may typically perform on your laptop.
As the name suggests, the application recognizes and responds to users through voice commands.
The reason for naming this app “CAPABLE” was no a coincidence: this project is specially geared towards aiding
the disabled community by providing them a simple and easy access to using their computers. The functionalities have
been chosen in a way to provide support to those who often face difficulty navigating devices designed for the
general masses.

Capable is developed in the form of a Web-App to make it extremely user-friendly and accessible by people of all ages
and abilities. However, it can also function without the internet, since  its speech recognition software does not
use wifi to run for most general functionalities, except while using google-related services such as paying youtube
videos, searching for information and looking up wikipedia.

The AI assistant works mainly through triggers i.e the user’s voice commands and greatly simplifies the
process of using computers, laptops and even mobile phones. It looks for certain keywords in the user’s
sentences/commands that activate its functionalities. The list of keywords can be found in the app itself,
or can be recited by Capable, if requested.

The app will regularly undergo changes with newer and better updates. Suggestions are always welcome!!
